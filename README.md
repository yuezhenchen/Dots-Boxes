# Dots-Boxes
This is the Code for Boston College 2018 Dots & Boxes Tournament and won the first price. My code is in Dots-Boxes/src/players/player8/. There is a copy of the player code named Dots&Boxes Player.java on profile page for viewing convenience.

I wrote the code with my partner Kaining Shen and utilized the platform provided by instructor Robert Muller for testing and competition. Due to the 2.5 seconds time limitation, I randomize the output until the board of game hit a certain point, which is specified in the Player8.java. Then the code will play for win and use strategies to deal with single boxes, double crosses, loops, and long chains.
